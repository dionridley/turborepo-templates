# Plan Management

This directory contains project plans in various stages of development.

## Workflow

1. **draft/** - New plans being developed or refined
2. **in_progress/** - Plans currently being implemented
3. **completed/** - Implemented plans (historical reference)

## Moving Plans Between Stages

- Plans start in `draft/` when being written
- Move to `in_progress/` when implementation begins
- Move to `completed/` when fully implemented

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with the pattern: `feature-name-plan.md`

Example: `vite-react-storybook-template.md`
